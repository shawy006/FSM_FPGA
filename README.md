PROJECT DESCRIPTION:	A basic sequence detector of which buttons are pressed. If the 
//							correct sequence is detected and the enter switch goes high,
// 							a blue LED will light, and a 392 Hz tone will sound. If not, 
//					        the red LED will light, and a 110 Hz tone will sound. There            
//                          is no overlap. The buttons I am using are 4 buttons built into
//                          the Arty z7-10 board.
//
//                          The enter sequence is BTN2, BTN3, BTN1, BTN3
