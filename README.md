PROJECT DESCRIPTION:	A basic sequence detector of which buttons are pressed. If the correct sequence is detected and the enter switch goes high, a blue LED will light, and a 392 Hz tone will sound. If not, the red LED will light, and a 110 Hz tone will sound. There is no overlap. The buttons I am using are 4 buttons built into the Arty z7-10 board.
                                                                         The enter sequence is BTN2, BTN3, BTN1, BTN3
